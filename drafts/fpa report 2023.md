# FPA report 2022/2023

## 2022 report

The first year of functioning of the [FreeCAD project association (FPA)](https://fpa.freecad.org) has been dense and full of achievements, and leaves us all thrilled and optimists for the future of the association. The FPA was born out of the action of a few veteran FreeCAD developers and community members, and, for practicability reasons, the largest part of the FreeCAD community was not involved in its creation and initial set up. Therefore, the FPA needed and still needs to gain trust and legitimacy from that community. This is done mainly through being transparent in everything the FPA does, but also right from the start as stated in the [FPA statutes](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/corporate/statutes.html), which define the role of the FPA as a tool, to be used by and to benefit the whole FreeCAD community.

All of us administrators and members of the FPA would like to thank all of you who put trust in it right from the start, donated to the project, and helped FreeCAD to go further and faster. 

Below are the highlights of what has been achieved in 2022.

### Initial setup of the FPA

The FPA has been set up in November 2021 as a Belgium-based [AISBL](https://justice.belgium.be/fr/themes_et_dossiers/societes_associations_et_fondations/associations/aisbl) (international non-profit association) and started officially to function in February 2022. The initial setup involved writing the association [statutes](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/corporate/statutes.html) and obtaining a [royal decree](https://fpa.freecad.org/royal_decree.pdf) that gave official birth to the association. The association was then [registered](https://kbopub.economie.fgov.be/kbopub/toonondernemingps.html?lang=en&ondernemingsnummer=781867807) and a bank account was opened. Accounts on different donation platforms where then also created, and the [FreeCAD website](https://freecad.org) was updated to inform users of the new donation possibilities.

A "Thank you" page has also been created, which is shown to users after they download a FreeCAD installer from the website, suggesting a donation to the project.

Everything we learned about setting up and running an AISBL has been [documented](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/corporate/aisbl_guide.html). We hope this can help other Free and Open-Source (FOSS) projects to take a step further and create a formal structure for it.

### Financial report

The project received during 2022 more than **USD 50 000**, an amount that exceeds by far the [expectations](https://fpa.freecad.org/budgets/2022.html). The donations came almost entirely from individuals, and only a few companies so far. The largest part of the donations is also made of one-time small amounts (USD 5 or less). Recurring donations amount for about **USD 600** per month.

In 2022, accounting has been done and reported each month in [simple table form](https://fpa.freecad.org/reports/2022). Starting in 2023, accounting is now done in a more complete, double-entry system based on [GnuCash](https://gnucash.org/). Monthly reports will still be issued by the administration team.

The FPA engaged in a few recurring engagements in 2022, namely subscriptions to services and platforms.

### Debts

The FPA has liquidated its initial debts, which were mostly sums of money paid by members for the initial setup and starts 2023 free from any debt.

### Assets

The FPA has acquired the control over the [freecad.org](https://freecad.org) domain, which was generously donated to the FreeCAD community by the [KiCAD Services Corp.](https://www.kipro-pcb.com/), and a [trademark](https://fpa.freecad.org/trademark.pdf) that helps us to protect the FreeCAD name and logo against unfair or malicious use.

### We learned to work together

It seemed simple, after all we are all working together since quite some time, but it turned out doing it in an official and accountable environment like the FPA, where you literally have to play with other people's money, is less simple. Decisions become very important, as are the ways these decisions are made. Everything needs to be transparent and justified.

We had some setbacks at first, we realized our voting system blocked us, but we learned to solve the issues and put things back on track. Now the FPA internals are really working well, and we are able to reach consensus very easily and quickly on most issues.

### FPA development grants

The FPA has launched a [development fund program](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fpadf-announcement) that distributes grants of USD 1000 to developers asking for it.  In 2022, two grants have been allocated. In 2023, we want to develop this program further to make it more attractive.

### FreeCAD day at FOSDEM

The FPA has organized a [FreeCAD meeting day](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/freecad-day-2023) to be held in Brussels in early february 2023, together with [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org). Many FreeCAD developers will attend, and everybody, being part of the FreeCAD community or just curious, is welcome to attend and participate. The FPA is also helping developers and community members to get to the event by [supporting part of the travel costs](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/fosdem-travel-grants).

Meeting in real-life is something very important and fruitful, any contributors of open-source projects who have experienced it will confirm it. Many new ideas start during these meetings. It is also a kind of reward, after having worked together for a long time, it is always nice to put faces on names.

### Blog post grants

The FPA has set up an official FreeCAD blog at [https://blog.freecad.org](https://blog.freecad.org). The general idea is to be able to provide useful information and insight over the FreeCAD development, reach outside the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecad.org) and to other FreeCAD communities on the web. A [blog posts grant system](https://fpa.freecad.org/programs/blog-content) has also been set up, where community members can receive a compensation for writing posts for the blog.

### New members have joined

The FPA [roster](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/people/roster.html) has expanded. More people have joined the FPA, and people have started assuming different roles or positions. So far the arriving of new members has been a spontaneous happening, without much regulation or direction, but as things ramp up, this is a question that is being put on the table to discuss.

### Administration team

The FPA administration team, currently composed of 4 members, is now working at full power. We maintain a weekly video meeting, and no week passes without several tasks being done. Everything we learn or set up is being dutifully documented in the [FPA handbook](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook). The handbook covers everything about how the FPA is organized and operated. The handbook is a reference for people outside the FPA, but also for ourselves, as it allows to test ideas, see how well they work.



### Plans for 2023

* Upgrade the FPA (enable commercial operations and deduce VAT)

* Export belgian part of accounting to hired accountant

* Based on current donations, expected gains of USD 75000

* Total in account at the end of 2023 if we don't do anything: 135 000

* Larger grants system where WE propose tasks (5000?) Ã  la GSOC

* Fund other specific projects (open contents, documentation...)

* Put a part of the 60 000 on a savings account

* Propose/develop a new documentation system

* Propose/develop a new parts library system
