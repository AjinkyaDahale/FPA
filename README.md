The **FreeCAD Project association** is an internal non-profit association created by FreeCAD administrators and core developers in November 2021 and seated in Belgium. Its goal is to support and protect the [FreeCAD project](https://freecad.org). 

The FreeCAD Project Association is composed of ordinary members, who form the general assembly, and an administrative body,  formed by the chairperson plus any number of other members elected to it. Meetings and votes of the members happen on a dedicated section of the [FreeCAD forum](https://forum.freecad.org).
