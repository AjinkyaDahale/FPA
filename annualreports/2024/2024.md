## Plans for 2024

We expect 2024 to be even busier than 2023.  Some of the things we hope to accomplish in 2024 are:


* **Hire an accountant** to handle Belgian reporting requirements, such as tax returns and VAT handling. Up to now, the FPA members have done all the accounting tasks themselves. Hiring an external accountant, however, will help to ensure that the FPA makes no accounting or tax errors, and will allow the FPA to keep functioning even in case of large changes among FPA members.

* **Establish a reserve fund** to protect against unplanned expenses.

## Financial Report

2023 was our first year of formal double entry bookkeeping.  This has provided greater insight into our financial situation and allowed us to easily comply with regulations.

In 2023, the FPA received donations of just over **€100,000**.  This amount exceeded our expectations.  The donations continue to come mainly from individuals in small amounts (less than €10).  We did note an increase in recurring donations from individuals.  Support from businesses increased in 2024, but remains a small portion of total revenue.

The FPA used four donation platforms in 2024:
* direct deposits to our bank account
* transfers to our PayPal account
* Github donations
* donations via Open Collective.

As far as we can determine, the BountySource donation platform has ceased operations and the FPA expects to write off our BountySource balance of approximately 4,0000 USD in 2024.  We have engaged a lawyer to pursue our rights in this matter, but we are not optimistic about a successful resolution.

The FPA spent approximately **€26,000** in 2023 with the majority being spend in the second half of the year.

### Debts

As of the end of 2023, the FPA had a total debt of €20.  This amount represents an accounting error related to mentor stipends for the Google Summer of Code and will be corrected in the January 2024 accounting period, leaving the FPA completely debt free.


### Non-financial Assets

The FPA owns the [freecad.org](https://freecad.org) domain and and a [trademark](https://fpa.freecad.org/trademark.pdf) that helps us to protect the FreeCAD name and logo against unfair or malicious use.

### 2024 Budget Estimate

* Income
  
  * We expect our 2024 income from all sources to be higher that 2023, just as donations in 2023 were higher than 2022.  Projecting 2023 Q3 and Q4 revenue across 2024, we should see an income of over €100,000.


* Expenses
  
  * We increased our spending in all areas in 2023, particularly in the second half of the year, and expect this to continue in 2024.  We improved our handling of grant proposals and our approach to soliciting grantees in 2023, although we did not reach planned spending levels. The lessons learned in 2023 will improve our ability to meet spending targets in 2024.
  
  * Projected spending in 2024
    * FPADF - €50,000
    * Event support - €10,000
    * Reserve fund - €20,000
    * Infrastructure - €5,000
    * Education Grants - €5,000
