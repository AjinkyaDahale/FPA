## Transparency
Transparency means we believe our decisions and official actions should be accessible to the general community. The FPA (and all organizations) need to keep some secrets (passwords, bank account numbers, etc). We occasionally need to keep things confidential that affect partners or individuals.

Likewise, to get the most honest deliberation and feedback on proposals, members need to feel comfortable to speak their minds.  Therefore our in

However, we strive to conduct our official actions in public view.

## Reputation

Many people feel uncomfortable using their real names on the internet. They prefer to use an alias.
This project respects the desire for people to maintain privacy.

However, we make a distinction between "Identity" and "Reputation".

### Identity
The identity is the identifier by which a person is known online.  This can be their real-world name or an alias.  It can even be multiple aliases if the person takes steps to clearly identify that all aliases refer to the same person.  This is quite common since a preferred nick or screenname may not be available on all platforms.

Identify can take three forms:

#### Anonymous
The identity has no identifying information, does not correllate with other platformsn, and has no history.

### Pseudoanonymity
The identity does not correllate with a real world person.  It does have a discernible history either on the FreeCAD platforms or other platforms like Github.

### Non-Anonymous
The identity correllates with a real-world person. They can be found on other platforms like linkedIN. They may use a headshot for an avatar picture.  They may have populated other personal information in their profile

### Reputation
Reputation is a separate concept but is related to identify.  The important thing is that a good reputation takes a long-time to establish and can be easily destroyed.  Thus people are careful to protect their reputation.

An anonymous account has no associated reputation. The owner has nothing to lose.  They are still a human being and should be respected as such. But unacceptable behavior should be swiftly addressed.

A pseudoanonymous account with a positive reputation should be recognized and respected commensurately.  However, a pseudoanonymous person can still walk away without damaging their real-world reputation.

A Non-anonymous person with a long history and solid reputation should be recognized as such.  They have tied their real-world reputation to their online activity.
