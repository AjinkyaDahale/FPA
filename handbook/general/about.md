# Mission

The purpose of this association is to **support the FreeCAD project**.

The FPA does not _run_ the FreeCAD project nor does it make technical decisions 
about the application.  Rather it seeks to improve the tools, community, strategic
relationships, and other aspects on which the project relies.

As a legal entity, the FPA is able to receive donations, pay for commercial
and products, organize events, and conduct other kinds of business that benefit the project.
