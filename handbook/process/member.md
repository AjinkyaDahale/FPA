# Adding members

## General Considerations

The FPA functions best with an active and participating membership.  Thus it is in our interest to regularly add new members and move inactive members to that status.

When proposing a vote to add members, the following criteria may be helpful:

* Is this person recognized and respected in the FreeCAD community?
    - Consider the age of their account on the Forum
    - Consider how often they have posted
    - Consider other ways in which they have contributed (translation, wiki, etc)
    - Read through some of their posts.  Is their tone helpful and professional?
* Is this person anonymous?
