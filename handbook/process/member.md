## General Considerations

The FPA functions best with an active and participating membership.  Thus it is in our interest to regularly add new members and move inactive members to that status.

When proposing a vote to add members, the following criteria may be helpful:

* Is this person recognized and respected in the FreeCAD community?
    - Consider the age of their account on the Forum
    - Consider how often they have posted
    - Consider other ways in which they have contributed (translation, wiki, etc)
    - Read through some of their posts.  Is their tone helpful and professional?
* Is this person anonymous?

## Adding General Assembly (GA) members

* contact them privately to see if they're interested
    * Point them to this handbook, particularly the page on expectations
* Conduct vote
* When approved:
    * Add them to forum permissions so they can see the group
    * 

## Adding Administrative Team (AT) members

Administrative team members should:
* Have a low-threshold to action.  They should be willing to take action, make changes, edit files, send pull requests etc without asking permission
* Have a good understanding of how the FPA operates
* Have a good history of availability and response.

* contact them privately to see if they're interested
* Conduct vote
* When approved
    * Add to FPA public and private repos
    * Update the roster
