## General Considerations

The FPA functions best with an active and participating membership.  Thus it is in our interest to regularly add new members and move inactive members to that status.

When proposing a vote to add members, the following criteria may be helpful:

* Is this person recognized and respected in the FreeCAD community?
    - Consider the age of their account on the Forum
    - Consider participation in non-Forum FreeCAD activities (e.g. social media groups, video sharing sites)
    - Consider how often they have posted
    - Consider other ways in which they have contributed (translation, wiki, tutorials, etc.)
    - Read through some of their posts.  Is their tone helpful and professional?
* Is this person anonymous?

## Adding General Assembly (GA) members

The process for adding members is designed to be straightforward, and to encourage the participation of a variety of interested community members.

To add a member to the GA:
* Contact them privately to see if they're interested
    * Point them to this handbook, particularly the page on expectations
* Conduct vote in the FPA Forum
* When approved:
    * Add them to forum permissions so they can see the group
    * Update the roster

## Adding Administrative Team (AT) members

Administrative team members should:
* Have a low threshold to action --
    * They should be willing to take action, make changes, edit files, send pull requests etc. without asking permission
    * They must be willing to take action on votes as approved by the GA
* Have a good understanding of how the FPA operates
* Have a good history of availability and response

To add a GA member to the AT:
* Contact them privately to see if they're interested
* Conduct vote in the FPA Forum
* When approved
    * Add to FPA public and private repos
    * Update the roster
    * If the new member doesn't already have a wordpress.com account, have them create one.  Then add it to the blog.freecad.org account so they can review and edit blog posts.
