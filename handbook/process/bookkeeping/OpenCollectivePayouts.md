# OpenCollective Payouts

OpenCollective will only release funds based on claims in the form of:
* an invoice from a supplier
* a request for reimbursement

In both cases, the payee is expected to submit the claim on the OpenCollective web site.

Amounts are paid out via PayPal or wire transfer (using WISE - www.wise.com).

## An example:

Jane Author submits a blog article that is accepted for publication.  Jane is now
eligible for a $100 payment.  Jane goes to the OpenCollective site and submits an
invoice to OpenCollective.  An FPA administrator reviews and approves Jane's invoice.
An OpenCollective staff member reviews Jane's invoice to ensure that all the necessary 
information is included.  If everything is in order, OpenCollective transfers $100 to 
Jane via PayPal (or Wise). 


## Open Collective and the IRS
OpenCollective operates under US Internal Revenue Service regulations which may impose limitations
on payment methods and destinations.  See https://docs.oscollective.org/how-it-works/basics for 
details.

Payees must provide a PayPal account (or, for Wise, banking details).  Payee must also provide
OpenCollective with a physical address.
