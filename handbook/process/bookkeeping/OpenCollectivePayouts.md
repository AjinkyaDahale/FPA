# OpenCollective Payouts

OpenCollective will only release funds based on claims in the form of:
* an invoice from a supplier
* a request for reimbursement

In both cases, the payee is expected to submit the claim on the OpenCollective web site.
To do this, the payee should have both an OpenCollective account and a PayPal account 
{if receiving the funds through PayPal)

Amounts are paid out via PayPal or wire transfer (using WISE - www.wise.com).

## An example:

Jane Author submits a blog article that is accepted for publication.  Jane is now
eligible for a $100 payment.  Jane goes to the OpenCollective site
(https://opencollective.com/freecad) and signs in (or creates a new account).
Jane then clicks on "submit expenses", then on "Invoice".  Jane fills out the payee
method of payment (generally PayPal) and submits the invoice to OpenCollective.

An OpenCollective staff member reviews Jane's invoice to ensure that all the necessary 
information is included.  Then an FPA administrator reviews and approves Jane's invoice.

If everything is in order, OpenCollective transfers $100 to Jane via PayPal (or Wise). 

## Open Collective and the IRS
OpenCollective operates under US Internal Revenue Service regulations which may impose limitations
on payment methods and destinations.  See https://docs.oscollective.org/how-it-works/basics for 
details.

Payees must provide a PayPal account (or, for Wise, banking details).  Payee must also provide
OpenCollective with a physical address.
