# Issuing Donation Refunds

Donors occasionally request a refund of their donation.  Most often they have set up
a recurring donation on their donation platform (ie PayPal) instead of a one time donation.

We typically refund the most recent donation, no questions asked.  However, we are not able
to make changes to the donor's platform account, so we can not change a recurring donation to
a one time donation.  The donor must make this change themselves.
