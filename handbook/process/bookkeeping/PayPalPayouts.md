# PayPal Payouts

PayPal is the easiest way to make payments for the FPA, but there are some things
to keep in mind.

## Currency
The FPA PayPal account is denominated in Euros (EUR).  Transfers may be made to
accounts in other currencies, but exchange fees will be levied.

## Transfer Fees
PayPal charges transfer fees on all transactions, but the amount of the fee can
be difficult to predict.  The fees depend on the amount of the transaction and the
Paypal "regions" involved.  A good estimate is 3.5% of the transaction amount plus
0.39 EUR.


## PayPal and regulations
The FPA PayPal account operates under Belgian/EU regulations which may impose limitations
on payment methods and destinations.
