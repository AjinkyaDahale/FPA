# Notes on Grants, Contracts and VAT

In general, the FPA issues "grants" to support the work of individuals on FreeCAD.  The FPA may
also contract with individuals or other bodies for the delivery of specific services.

If there is a contract, then VAT is likely involved.

A grant ["refers to funds that are awarded to the recipient to enable the performance of self-directed research, where there is no contractual obligation for performance."](https://www.sfu.ca/research/researcher-resources/proposal-development/grants-vs-contracts)


Grants & VAT

["Grants are outside the scope of VAT as long as the funding is not conditional a service being provided in return for the funding."](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/finance/how/taxation/vat/vatincome/vatgrants)


[A discussion about grants vs contracts and their VAT implications](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-supply-and-consideration/vatsc06311)
"When an organisation identifies a need it wishes to fulfil, and decides not to do so itself, it may either:

    enter into an agreement with another body to undertake the task, and fund that bodyâ€™s costs through a grant or subsidy; or
    enter into a contract for the procurement of services (and possibly goods) to enable the task to be completed

The former is not a supply for VAT and will commonly be described as a grant. The latter is a supply for VAT but you may see instances where such arrangements are never the less described as a grant."
