#Grant Payouts

The FPA administers a Development Fund which provides grants to contributors.  This
fund was established by a vote 2022-11-15.  These grants are valued in USD.

The FPA also provides grants to defray travel costs to events such as FOSDEM.  These grants are
generally valued in USD.

As a concession to our accounting software, grant recipients are considered to be "suppliers".

## Grant proposals and approvals 
Grant awards are subject to a positive vote by the FPA.  Once the award is approved,
an Accounts Payable transaction should be entered against **A/P Suppliers USD**.  If the 
receipient has not already be created as a supplier, that should be done at this time.

## Grant payments
When the payment is to be issued to the receipient, an invoice should be created, posted and
paid. The payment should be charged to the appropriate account, such as  **FPADF Grants** or **Event Support**.
