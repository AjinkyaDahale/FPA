# Process for FPADF Grants

The FPA administers a Development Fund which provides grants to contributors.  This
fund was established by a vote 2022-11-15.  These grants are valued in USD.

The FPA also provides grants to defray travel costs to events such as FOSDEM.  These grants are
generally valued in USD.

## Documenting a Grant award
If there is to be a gap between awarding of the Grant and the actual payment, then generally accepted
accounting practices would suggest that the award be recorded as a liability and then charged to the 
FPADF account when money is actually paid out.  As we are not bookkeepers, we will just record the
payout to a "Valeurs disponsible" account and the FPADF expense account.

### Grant proposals and approvals 
A proposal must be provided for all grants. Grant awards are subject to a positive vote by the FPA.

### Bookkeeping for grant payouts
Create a transaction charging the grant amount to the appropriate account, offset against the
account providing the funds.  Any fees involved should also be added to the transaction.

Normally a Github issue is created for each payment.
