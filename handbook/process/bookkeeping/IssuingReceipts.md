# Issuing Donation Receipts

Donors occasionally request a receipt for their donation.  Use the [receipt template](./receiptTemplate.md) for this.
Enter the donation data and save under an appropriate name.  The donation should be signed by inserting an image of
the issuer's signature.  Save your signature image as "signature.png" in the same directory as the receipt.

Use a utility like MarkText to covert the md file to a PDF.  Attach the PDF to an email from your FreeCAD.org
account to the donor.

Note that the FPA is not registered as a charitable organization.  It is up to the donor to determine the tax
implications of a donation to the FPA.
