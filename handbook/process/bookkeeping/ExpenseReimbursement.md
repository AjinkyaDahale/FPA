# Reimbursement of Expenses

FPA members (and non-members) may incur costs on behalf of the Association.  The costs must 
be reimbursed.

## Reimbursable expenses
Only items that are a) approved by the FPA membership in a vote, or b) within a member's 
pre-authorized spending authority will be considered for reimbursement.  The expense must be
clearly to the benefit of the association, and not to that of the member.


## Planned Expenses
Pre-approved expenses should be recorded as an obligation in the FPA accounts.  As a concession
 to our accounting software, anybody to be reimbursed at a later date will be considered to be
 "employees", even though there is no actual employment relationship.

### Documenting a Planned Expense
Approved expenditures should be recorded immediately by a transaction against 
**Dettes à l'égard des membres** (debts to members) offset against the appropriate
**Depenses** subaccount.

If the person incurring the expense has not already been created as an "employee", that
should be done at this time.

### Planned Expense payments
When the payment is to be issued to the member, and expense voucher should be created, posted
and paid.  The receipient, an invoice should be created, posted and
paid. The payment should be charged back to **Dettes à l'égard des membres** and offset against
the appropriate **Valeurs disponibles** subaccount.


## After the Fact Expenses
The bookkeeping requirements to document a expense after the fact are simpler.

### Bookkeeping for After the Face Expenses
Create a transaction charging the expense amount to the appropriate account, offset against the
account providing the funds.  Any fees involved should also be added to the transaction.
