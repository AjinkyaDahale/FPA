# Reimbursement of Expenses

FPA members (and non-members) may incur costs on behalf of the Association.  The costs must 
be reimbursed.

## Reimbursable expenses
Only items that are a) approved by the FPA membership in a vote, or b) within a member's 
pre-authorized spending authority will be considered for reimbursement.  The expense must be
clearly to the benefit of the association, and not to that of the member.

## Planned Expenses
If there is to be a gap between incurring the cost and making the reimbursement, then generally accepted
accounting practices would suggest that the award be recorded as a liability and then charged to the 
appropriate account when money is actually paid out.  As we are not bookkeepers, we will just record the
payout to a "Valeurs disponsible" account and the appropriate expense account.

### Bookkeeping for Expenses
Create a transaction charging the expense amount to the appropriate account, offset against the
account providing the funds.  Any fees involved should also be added to the transaction.

Normally a Github issue is created for each payment.
