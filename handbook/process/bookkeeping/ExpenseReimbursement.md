#Reimbursement of Expenses

FPA members (and non-members) may incur costs on behalf of the Association.  The costs must 
be reimbursed.

As a concession to our accounting software, anybody being reimbursed will be considered to be 
"employees", even though there is no actual employment relationship.

## Reimbursable expenses
Only items that are a) approved by the FPA membership in a vote, or b) within a member's 
pre-authorized spending authority will be considered for reimbursement.  The expense must be
clearly to the benefit of the association, and not to that of the member.

## Recording expenses
Approved expenditures should be recorded immediately by a transaction against 
**Dettes à l'égard des membres** (debts to members) offset against the appropriate
**Depenses** subaccount.

If the person incurring the expense has not already been created as an "employee", that
should be done at this time.

## Expense payments
When the payment is to be issued to the member, and expense voucher should be created, posted
and paid.  The receipient, an invoice should be created, posted and
paid. The payment should be charged back to **Dettes à l'égard des membres** and offset against
the appropriate **Valeurs disponibles** subaccount.

## Paying from BountySource
To pay an expense claim from the FPA BountySource account:
* create an issue for the expense in the FPA Github repo. 
* post a bounty on BountySource
* close the issue on Github
* have the member claim the bounty on BountySource
* approve the member's claim on BountySource
* BountySource will transfer the money to the member.
