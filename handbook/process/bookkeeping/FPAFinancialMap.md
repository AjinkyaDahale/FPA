## FPA Expenses

FPA Expenses are paid by:

* transfers from the FPA bank account to another bank account
* transfers from the FPA PayPal account to another PayPal account
* transfers from OpenCollective to a PayPal account
* transfers from BountySource to a PayPal account.  BountySource will also issue wire transfers, but the fees involved make this an impractical method.

The FPA does not currently (2022-12-15) use a credit card.  Expenses that require
the use of a credit card are paid by an FPA member who then applies for reimbursement.


## Fees
All of the financial institutions used by the FPA charge fees (rates as of 2022-12-15).

* BNP charges periodic account maintenance fees as well as charges for transfers and currency exchanges.
* PayPal takes 2.9% + E0.30 per transaction at the time of deposit.
* OpenCollective takes %5 on incoming transaction made by credit card. A higher rate (8%) applies to transactions via cheque or bank draft.
* BountySource takes %10 on outgoing transactions.
