# Rationale

In order to pass any voted initiative, two criteria must be met.
1. At least half of the active FPA members must cast a vote
2. One of the options must receive a majority of votes

The FPA has occasionally had a problem with members not voting at all. This is a serious problem because it means we cannot fulfill our mission.

A rule was adopted that lets the Administrative team periodically call for 'Reconfirmation'.
Any member who does not reconfirm is placed on the inactive member list.

# Process

1. The Chairman or another member of the Administrative Team calls for a reconfirmation by posting to the FPA section of the forum.  The topic title must be "[RECONFIRMATION CALL] Action Required".
2. The topic is marked "sticky" so it remains at the top of the page.
3. Each member MUST reply to the topic stating that the want to remain active.
4. After 14 day, the person calling for reconfirmation will change the topic title to "[RECONFIRMATION CALL] CLOSED"
5. The person calling for reconfirmation will compare the respondents to the current roster. Any member who did not reply or who replied asking to be inactive will be moved to the inactive section of the roster.

# Reactivation

If an inactive member wishes to be reactivated, they simply need to contact a member of the administrative team and notify them of their intent to participate.
