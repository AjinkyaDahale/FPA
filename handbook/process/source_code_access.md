## Overview

Although the FreeCAD Project Association does not decide who has write access to the main FreeCAD source code repository, it is responsible for taking the actual technical steps necessary to control access to that repository. Once a vote of the FreeCAD Maintainers team has been taken and access rights to the repository have been granted or removed, the FPA will take the steps necessary to actually establish the agreed-upon access rights. The steps for doing so are detailed below.

The current primary "depot" for FreeCAD's source code is hosted at GitHub, https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD.

## Adding a Maintainer

To add a new Maintainer to the FreeCAD repository, [a member of the FPA with "Owner" access](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/people?query=role%3Aowner) to the source code repository  will:
1. Log into GitHub and go to https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/settings/access (this will require two-factor authentication).
2. Go to the Maintainers team
3. Click "Add a member" to add to the team

## Removing a Maintainer

To remove a Maintainer from the FreeCAD repository,  [a member of the FPA with "Owner" access](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/people?query=role%3Aowner) to the source code repository will:
1. Log into GitHub and go to https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/settings/access (this will require two-factor authentication).
2. Go to the Maintainers team
3. Check the box next to the member being removed
4. Choose "Remove from team" from the drop-down box
5. Confirm the removal in the dialog that appears
