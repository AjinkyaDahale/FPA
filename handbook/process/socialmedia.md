## Overview

There are a number of official FreeCAD social media accounts, including a Twitter handle and a blog. The FreeCAD Project Association (FPA) is responsible for maintaining and overseeing those accounts, and ensuring the necessary access, including selecting an Editor for the blog, and granting/revoking access as necessary.

## Blog

The official FreeCAD blog, FreeCAD News, is located at https://blog.freecad.org. Its current Editor-in-chief is Chris Hennes (chennes). It is hosted as a managed Wordpress site, and access to it is granted via wordpress.com accounts. Articles are published once per week, on Wednesdays at 9am CET. Articles may be submitted by any interested parties by sending them to the Editor for consideration.
