#### Determining the type of the AISBL

The size of the AISBL determines its accounting obligations:

* The **nano association** does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:     
  * 5 full-time equivalent (FTE) workers on average over the year
  * € 334,500 in revenue excluding VAT (excluding exceptional revenue)
  * € 1,337,500 in total Assets
  * € 1,337,500 in total Debts
* The **micro association** does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:     
  * 10 FTE workers on average over the year
  * € 7,000,000 in turnover excluding VAT (excluding exceptional receipts)
  * € 3,500,000 balance sheet total 3. 
* The **small association** does not exceed more than 1 of the following criteria:
  * 50 FTE workers on average over the year
  * € 9,000,000 in turnover excluding VAT (excluding exceptional receipts)
  * € 4,500,000 balance sheet total
* The **large association**  exceeds more than 1 of the following criteria:
  * 50 FTE workers on average over the year
  * € 9,000,000 in turnover excluding VAT (excluding exceptional receipts)
  * € 4,500,000 balance sheet total

#### General assembly

The association must hold, at least once a year, a general assembly meeting, where, at minimum, the approval of last year's **financial report** and next year's **expenditure budget** must be voted. The way the meeting is organised is determined by the statutes or other internal ruling. There is no mandatory date to perform the meeting, but it must happen once a year and is usually done **before April**.

#### Yearly financial report

Each year, a financial report must be established, giving:

* The detail of all **money earned and spent** by the association over the past year
* All **assets** (money and goods) owned by the association
* All **debts** the association has

The form this report must be made and filed depends on the size of the association determined above:

* nano associations can opt for a **simplified report** which needs to be filed each year to the **Entreprise Court's greffe**.
* micro and small associations must use **double-entry accounting** and submit their report to the **national bank of Belgium**.
* large associations must also use double-entry accounting, use an extended report system and submit it to the national bank of Belgium.

##### Simplified report

The simplified report can be made on a single sheet, and must contain [name of the association, juridic form (AISBL), address, entreprise number and year](https://tcfb.be/associations-et-fondations-bilans-comptes-annuels/) and tables for income, spending, assets and debts. See [model here](https://www.associatiffinancier.be/COMPTA/La%20nouvelle%20compta%20des%20petites%20asbl.pdf) (last page). The report must be delivered physically at the [Greffe du Tribunal de l'entreprise](https://tcfb.be/greffe/) (section des personnes morales, Boulevard de la Deuxième Armée Britannique 148, in Forest) and must include:

* Two signed copies of the report

* One copy of the last general assembly minutes (procès-verbal) that approves the report, signed by the administrators

* One signed copy of the [attestation d'identité](https://tcfb.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ANNEXE-3-Attestation-didentit%C3%A9.pdf) form

* One copy of the deponent's identity card

More info on the [associations page](https://tcfb.be/greffe-des-asbl/) of the Greffe

This must be done maximum **one month after the annual general assembly meeting**

#### Budget

All non-profit organisations are required to draw up a budget each year for the following financial year and have it approved by the General Assembly, no later than **6 months after the end of the year**. The form of your budget can be chosen freely, as it is not determined by legal provisions. It is nevertheless advisable to draw up the budget on the basis of the same diagram as the annual accounts. 

The budget remains internal. Unlike annual accounts, it is not registered with a third party.

#### Tax declaration

Associations must submit each year a [tax declaration](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/asbl/impots_et_tva/declaration-asbl-impot-des-personnes-morales).

The association can be subject to the **legal persons tax** regime, or **societies tax** regime. Basically, it is submitted to the legal persons tax if it does not perform any commercial operation, ans to the societies tax if it engages in commercial operations (ie, it sells goods).

With the legal persons tax regime, an ASBL is in principle **not taxed on the profits made** (for example, the receipts from a spaghetti evening that you organize occasionally to finance the objectives of your ASBL). You therefore do not have to include these profits in the declaration. However, certain other income **must be declared**: 

* real estate income located in Belgium (except income from private rentals, market garden and agricultural rents, rentals to non-profit tenants) or located abroad (unless a double taxation agreement provides for taxation in the country in which the property is located)
* income from movable and capital property (both received and allocated) (a non-profit organization must also pay withholding tax for certain income and therefore complete a declaration for withholding tax 273 or 273A)
* certain capital gains on land located in Belgium or on certain rights in rem on this land
* certain capital gains on buildings located in Belgium or on certain rights in rem on these buildings    
* capital gains on major holdings (sale, exchange, contribution, etc.)
* financial benefits or advantages of any kind (in the context of corruption)
* pensions, lump sums, employer contributions and bonuses
* unjustified costs or benefits of any kind, and corruption
* car expenses up to a portion of the benefit in kin
* the costs of the mobility allowance up to a proportion of the benefit in kind 

You must be able to justify all the income and expenditure of your non-profit organization with supporting documents. Unjustified expenses may possibly be penalized by a maximum tax at the rate of 102%.

The declaration must be submitted **by October 28**.

#### VAT

Registering to the VAT is mandatory for all associations or companies engaging in commercial activities (the selling of goods or services). See [registering instructions here](creation). Once an association is registered, it must:

* File monthly (default) or quarterly (if allowed at creation) reports, stating the total amount of operations (in and out) subject to VAT. Reports must follow a [specific calendar](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/entreprises/tva/declaration/declaration-periodique#q4)

* File yearly list of VAT clients the AISBL has sold goods or services to

* Retain a VAT of 21% over all sold goods or services, and pay that amount quarterly to the finance administration

* Apply [reverse charging](https://vatdesk.eu/en/eu-vat-news/reverse-charge-in-belgium/) when buying or selling goods or services from / to a body subject to VAT in another EU country

The finance ministry website provides [information in english](https://finance.belgium.be/en/enterprises/vat) or [in french (with more information)](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/entreprises/tva) over all the details of VAT declaration

#### UBO register

The [UBO register](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/E-services/ubo-register) is an anti-corruption and anti-money-laundry system in Belgium, that keeps track of possible beneficiaries of companies and associations. For non-profit organizations and foundations, the following are considered effective beneficiaries:

* Administrators
* The people who are authorised to represent the association
* The people in charge of the daily management of the non-profit organization or the foundation
* The founders of a foundation
* The natural persons or, when these persons have not yet been designated, the category of natural persons in whose main interest the non-profit organization or the foundation was formed or operates. This is mainly when the association is specifically aimed at funding a certain person or designated group of people
* Any other natural person exercising by other means the ultimate control over the non-profit organisation or foundation

The UBO register must be **kept updated each year** with the **effective beneficiaries** of the association. It can be accessed with the Belgian ID card of one of the administrators registered as such at the crossroads bank. There is no limit date specified, but any change of beneficiaries must be registered **within one month** to the UBO register.

Only administrators registered at the crossroads bank (see below) can be added as beneficiaries.

#### Administrators register update

Each time there is a change in the adminstrators roster, these changes must be communicated to the [Greffe du Tribunal de l'entreprise](https://tcfb.be/greffe/) (ssection des personnes morales). Doing this publishes the changes to the national gazette, and updates the crossroads bank register. Need to be filed:

* Form 1 and 2 from [Formulaires pour publication au Moniteur belge](http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/info_tsv_pub/form_f.htm) with sections A and B (form 1) and section A and C (form 2) filled

* Section B must be delivered in 3 signed copies

* Proof of payment of the publishing tax

* One signed copy of the [attestation d'identité](https://tcfb.be/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ANNEXE-3-Attestation-didentit%C3%A9.pdf) form

* One copy of the deponent's identity card

* One copy of the general assembly minutes that enables the administrators

* Copy of identity card and passports of all new administrators

* Proof of residence (phone bill, etc) of all new administrators

* RBIS number of all new administrators

The publishing tax for ASBLs/AISBLs is of € 157,42 in 2023 (check every year) to be paid to IBAN BE48 6792 0055 0227 with the entreprise number as communication.

#### Associations tax

ASBLs/AISBLs with **more than € 25,000 in assets** are subject to an [annual tax](https://finances.belgium.be/fr/asbl/impots-tva/taxe-annuelle-asbl) of 0.17% of their declared assets value, not counting liquidities (*fonds de roulement*). If the ASBL's assets are less than or equal to € 25,000, it is not subject to the tax. It is, however, still required to fill a declaration and indicate that the assets do not exceed € 25,000.

The declaration must be filed **no later than March 31**. Each ASBL receives, in principle, an invitation from the Legal Security office to submit a declaration during the month of February.

#### Social report

Non-profit organisations that employ an average of 20 or more staff per year, including small non-profit organisations, must draw up a social balance sheet.

## Employment and contracting

AISBLs can contract workers, either as **independent workers** or **employee workers**.

Warning, a member of the AISBL being contracted as a worker (independent or employee) can often be seen as a conflict of interests. Such situations need to be extremely well and clearly formulated and written.

#### Employee workers

Contracting **employees** requires a large amount of [administrative procedures](http://vieassociative.be/sites/default/files/20150819-formalites-administratives-engager-travailleur.pdf) (FR), mainly register to different social security levels and contract an insurance against work damages. An employee contract can be full or part time, and with no time limit or with a certain time frame, for a certian kind of tasks or not. Part of employment boost measures, Belgium offers several kinds of helps to employers.

#### Independent workers

An AISBL can contract an independent worker without any regulation or inscription. However, in this case, all the burden of taxes, social securities and everything else is the responsability of the worker. It is therefore important that the worker shows their compliance to this. It is usually done by issuing an **invoice** where details over the worker's social security or tax inscription are given, which could allow the AISBL to check that the worker is indeed in order with their tax administration.
