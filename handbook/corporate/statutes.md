### 1. Name and form

It is hereby created an **international association with non-profit aim** named: “**The FreeCAD project association**”. This association is ruled by Part III, Book 10 of the Code of Societies and Associations under the Belgian law. It is created for an undefined duration.



### 2. Seat location

The seat of this association is located in the judiciary region of Brussels, Belgium. The seat can be transferred to any other location in Belgium by decision of the administrative body.



### 3. Purpose of this association

The purpose of this association is to **support the FreeCAD project**. This includes, but is not limited to:

**Collect financial means** to fund activities that serve the purpose of this association. Examples include but are not limited to: buying support material and services (servers, web hosting, online services, etc.); support for organizing gatherings of FreeCAD community members or helping FreeCAD community members to participate in related events (by paying travel expenses, inscription fees, etc.); contracting developers to work on specific features; supporting other free and open-source projects beneficial to FreeCAD; encouraging the general development of a free CAD ecosystem around FreeCAD.

**Use the legal personality** of this association to represent the FreeCAD project, for example before bodies who need a physical or moral person as an interlocutor, such as companies or legal institutions, to demonstrate fair rights over internet domain names or social network handles, assume copyright for possible patent-breaking code in FreeCAD, protecting developers subject to possible patent infringement lawsuits in countries where these exist, or hold any other kind of assets in name of the FreeCAD project or FreeCAD community.

**Protect the FreeCAD project** by zealously maintaining it as a community-owned project that functions transparently and is accessible to all.



### 4. Definitions

**FreeCAD** is a free and open-source CAD (Computer-Aided Design) and 3D modelling software application developed originally by Jürgen Riegel, and identified by the **freecad.org** internet domain. It is made of: 1) The **source code of the application** hosted on different online platforms; and 2) The **associated documentation**. Both the source code and the documentation are publicly available and published entirely under **open-source licenses**.

FreeCAD is developed and maintained by a community, hereby named **the FreeCAD community**.

The **FreeCAD project** is the sum of all efforts put by the community into maintaining and developing the FreeCAD software and related ressources. This includes coding, bug tracking, bug triage and bug resolution. It also includes documentation and translation of the user interface and documentation. It includes attracting users and supporting them. It further includes advocacy of FreeCAD interests in the larger free and open-source software community and encouraging the development of related plug-ins, libraries and tools, and technologies beneficial to the FreeCAD application.

The **FreeCAD community** is made of all the persons or bodies who take part in the FreeCAD project by contributing their time, talent, or resources.

These persons or bodies contribute to the FreeCAD project on a free and voluntary basis, although they might receive material compensation for doing so from individuals, companies, institutions interested in investing financial means to develop FreeCAD. These individuals, companies or institutions are also considered part of the community.

The community has no official protocol, existence or means of communication. Its members gather mostly around the FreeCAD forum and social networks and are solely united by their will to make FreeCAD better.

Community members retain full **copyright** over the code, documentation or graphical material they produce for FreeCAD, unless they wish to attribute it to this association.

**FreeCAD administrators and core developers** are members of the community with special responsibilities and permissions necessary to carry out duties related to the FreeCAD project. This may include but isn't limited to forum moderators, code and translation repository managers, wiki administrators, and other system administrators. Administrators and core developers have a proven history of trustworthiness or competence in key areas.



### 5. Membership
