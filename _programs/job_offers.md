## Current job offers

### Manual update proposal

The FreeCAD project association (FPA) is seeking interested parties to apply for a contractor position to update the FreeCAD manual. The manual consists of 23 chapters that tour the user through basic concepts and different functionalities of FreeCAD. It is hosted on the FreeCAD wiki at [https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual](https://wiki.freecad.org/Manual).

The current manual is obsolete: It contains many parts that reflect an earlier version of the software, and several newer and better workflows are not included. We need to provide a state-of-the-art manual that reflects the bleeding edge version of FreeCAD, so it can become tied with the next stable version.

The work is expected initially to be carried out in a period of two or three months, but something else can be proposed by the candidate. A payment of **2500 USD** will be done in several instalments, to be determined by a payment schedule later on.

The tasks to be carried are:

* Check the entire manual for errors, inaccuracies and formatting mistakes
* Replicate all the exercises and step-by-step instructions and adapt workflows and rolls that have changed
* Identify and rewrite all parts that are obsolete or depend on an obsolete module or functionality
* Redo all the screenshots when needed by the changes above, using always a theme compatible and similar to the current screenshots.
* Verify the navigation system and redo or fix what does not work well
* Create the necessary scripts to produce a pdf and an epub version of the manual
* Verify and fix formatting problems in the pdf and epub versions
* Explore and document possibilities to produce a printed version of the manual

## Eligibility

* Any contributor, FreeCAD community member or just anybody else who wishes to be considered for one of the programs above should submit a proposal in writing to the FPA. The proposal should minimally contain:

  1. Your understanding and acceptance of all the conditions stated on this page
  2. Desmonstration that you have the required skills, motivation, or any other reason why you are the right person to do the job
  3. A plan of what you intent to do (it might differ from our proposal above)

* All candidates will be considered by the FPA general body and approved by vote.

## General conditions

* The tasks described in the job description above and the conditions below will be be gathered into a contract, to be signed by the candidate.

* The tasks needed to perform the given job are meant to be organised and performed by the candidate in the manner, schedule and time frame that the candidate sees appropriate, from their own location, using their own equipment, and establishing their own schedule and timetable. The FPA will help, but the responsability is of the candidate.

* The candidate is the sole responsible for the quality of their work. There is no subordination relationship between the FPA and the candidate.

* This agreement is a strict non-employment agreement. The candidate agrees to the conditions of this agreement as an independent worker. There is no employment relationship between the FPA and the candidate The candidate is solely responsible for paying all taxes such as revenue taxes incurring from the revenues obtained from this agreement, and for paying all social security contributions needed in the candidate's country, and any other expense needed to perform their work as an independent worker.
