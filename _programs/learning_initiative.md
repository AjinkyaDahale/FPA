# FreeCAD learning initiative

An initiative supported by the FPA to help teaching and learning FreeCAD

## The Program

FreeCAD has been notoriously found by many people hard to learn and is too absent from classrooms, be it in universities, high schools or technical schools. This initiative aims at bettering the situation by building a plan, or a series of actions that can be undertaken to make FreeCAD easier to learn and be discovered and integrated by teachers into their courses. 

The FPA is therefore looking for people willing to help building such a plan, and to carry out its items afterwards.

This includes:

#### Teaching

* Identify the different academic and technical areas where teaching FreeCAD would be interesting

* Identify teachers that are already including FreeCAD in their courses, and propose them to give us some feedback over it

* Identify teachers interested in participating in this program, and set up meetings or other forms of communications

* Plan, prepare, build and launch a **learn.freecad.org** portal dedicated to teaching and learning FreeCAD

* Build a comprehensive list of quality FreeCAD example files

* Create PDF  or printable material aimed at teachers from the different areas identified above

#### Learning

* Identify different areas and groups of people who have difficulties learning how to use FreeCAD

* Identify and build a list of specific workflows that should have better learning material

* Identify people willing to write tutorials

* Elaborate a FPA program to incentive / remunerate people to write quality tutorials
