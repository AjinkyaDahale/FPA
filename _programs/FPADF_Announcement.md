## Announcement - FPA Development Fund

The FreeCAD Project Association is pleased to announce the creation of the FPA Development Fund (FPADF). The FPADF offers grants to individuals for contributions to FreeCAD.

Grants are capped at US$5000 and will be awarded only for work on the FreeCAD code base.

The cap may be raised as the FPA gains experience in the awarding of grants and as available funds allow.

Any contributor who wishes to be considered for a grant should submit a proposal in writing to the FPA. The proposal should state clearly how much money is requested and what the contributor intends to create/improve/fix. An estimated timeline with major milestones should be included along with clear completion criteria.

Proposals will be considered by the FPA general body and approved by vote.

The FreeCAD Project Association would like to expand the number and type of grants given.  Donations made to the FPA and designated DEVELOPMENT FUND will be used for this purpose. 

Grant applications may be forwarded to any member of the FPA for consideration.

## Funded Initiatives

The following is a reverse-chronological-order list of projects funded by the FreeCAD Project Association under the FPADF:

### Lei Zheng (@realthunder): Topological Naming Problem Mitigation

*Funding approved 15 November 2022.*

In recognition of the efforts he has put into FreeCAD, especially the very large time investment he has made in working with the FreeCAD Maintainers to integrate his work on the topological naming problem, Zheng is awarded a grant of 1000 USD.

### Ajinkya Dahale (@jnxd): Spline Handling in Sketcher

*Funding approved 26 September 2022.*

Ajinkya proposed numerous improvements to the spline handling in the sketcher workbench. He raised funds from many members to do this work and has largely completed stage one. The FPA contributed to the second stage which focused on functionality to create more interesting curves not possible by knot position and slope alone. In recognition of his significant contribution to FreeCAD, Dahale is awarded a grant of 1000 USD.

### Adrian Insauuralde (@adrianinsaval): Packaging

*Funding approved 13 July 2023.*

Adrian proposed to work on release packaging, by fixing the conda builds and the process to generate packages for the different platforms, and documenting the process in the developers handbook. Adrian is awarded a grant of 1200 USD.

### Benjamin Bræstrup Sayoc (@bensay): Fix Issue #5903

*Funding approved 3 August 2023.*

Bensay is implementing the autofilling of text fields in SVG page templates in TechDraw workbench. He was awarded a grant of 500 USD.

### AgCaliva (@AgCaliva): Per-document Unit Selector

*Funding approved 3 August 2023.*

AgCaliva implemented a simple per-document unit selector in FreeCAD. He was awarded a grant of 600 USD.

### Alexandre Prokoudine (@prokoudine): New grant program

*Funding approved 19 July 2023.*

Alexandre is revamping the grant program for FreeCAD Project association to make it more attractive to new contributors. He was awarded an overall grant of 3500 USD — 1500 for initial research and 2000 for designing the new program.

### Chris Jones (@ipatch): Improvements to Homebrew FreeCAD Setup

*Funding approved 12 September 2023.*

Chris will implement autoconnection of homebrew-freecad to self-hosted runners, create GitHub actions to perform autochecks for changed dependencies and then rebuild them, and add regular bundle builds. He will also look into making homebrew-freedesk compatible with linuxbrew. Chris was awarded a grant of 1000 USD.

### Amulya Paritosh and Harshita Saraswat: Extension to The Component Library 

*Funding approved 31 October 2023.*

This project aims to complete the work started by Amulya Paritosh during the Google Summer of Code 2023. Amulya and his colleague Harshita Saraswat will do the remainder of the server-side work (authentication and authorization, launching the server on FreeCAD's server) and client-side work (using GitHub API key to upload files, inserting a component from an online library into FreeCAD). This project has an extension: Amulya will also work on dynamic properties for components in the online library. Amulya Paritosh and Harshita Saraswat were awarded a grant of 2500 USD each for the completion of the original project. Amulya was also awarded a 1000 USD grant for the extension project.

### Kurt Kremitzki (@kkremitzki): Improved Infrastructure Performance and Maintenance

*Funding approved 17 November 2023.*

Kurt will transition all existing services to a declarative format using Ansible, then translate that configuration into a set of Dockerfiles and Docker Compose configuration. He will also create a GitHub repository to centralize the management and automation of the infrastructure. Kurt was awarded a grant of 8000 USD.

### Ajinkya Dahale (@jnxd): Curve Geometry Improvements

*Funding approved 26 November 2023.*

Ajinkya will implement general tangency with B-splines and make it possible to preview B-splines when drawing them. He will also implement Bezier curves, add a curvature constraint, and improve support for joining curves. Ajinkya was awarded a grant of 5000 USD.

### Bradley Mclean (@bgbsww): Toponaming issue mitigation

*Funding approved 22 January 2024.*

Bradley will be working for two months on integrating fixes for the toponaming issue from RealThunder's branch to upstream FreeCAD. He was awarded a grant of 4800 USD.

### Vincenzo Calligaro (@CalligaroV): Toponaming issue mitigation

*Funding approved 22 January 2024.*

Vincenzo will be working for two months on integrating fixes for the toponaming issue from RealThunder's branch to upstream FreeCAD. He was awarded a grant of 3400 EUR.
