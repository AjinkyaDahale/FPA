## Announcement - FPA Development Fund

The FreeCAD Project Association is pleased to announce the creation of the FPA Development Fund (FPADF). The FPADF offers grants to individuals for contributions to FreeCAD.

Grants are capped at US$5000 and will be awarded only for work on the FreeCAD code base.

The cap may be raised as the FPA gains experience in the awarding of grants and as available funds allow.

Any contributor who wishes to be considered for a grant should submit a proposal in writing to the FPA. The proposal should state clearly how much money is requested and what the contributor intends to create/improve/fix. An estimated timeline with major milestones should be included along with clear completion criteria.

Proposals will be considered by the FPA general body and approved by vote.

The FreeCAD Project Association would like to expand the number and type of grants given.  Donations made to the FPA and designated DEVELOPMENT FUND will be used for this purpose. 

Grant applications may be forwarded to any member of the FPA for consideration.

### Lei Zheng (@realthunder): Topological Naming Problem Mitigation

*Funding approved 15 November 2022.*

### Ajinkya Dahale (@jnxd): Spline Handling in Sketcher

*Funding approved 26 September 2022.*

In recognition of his significant contribution to FreeCAD, Dahale is awarded a grant of 1000 USD.

### Adrian Insauuralde (@adrianinsaval): Packaging
