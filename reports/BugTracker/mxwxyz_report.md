## 2024-03-15
I've started my activity on 2024-02-12 and made myself familiar with the bug tracker system. From the beginning I've tried to closely keep up with new issues, checking their quality and classifying them.

My intention is to look at and categorize all issues and lable them either as **bug** (errors / failures in the current features) or **feature** (improvements and new features). All issues should be tagged with the corresponding workbench and topic specific tags will be applied (e.g. UI/UX, Units,...). 
Issues wich still need refinement, information from the author or other users are tagged with the corresponding `Missing: ...` tags. If necessary, relevant developers will be pinged. I try to reproduce all bugs if possible and check for already existing issues which are either related or a duplicate. Same logic will be applied when revisiting all existing issues.

### Current statistics this month:
|Metric|Count|
|:---|---:|
|**New** issues this month: | 219 |
|**Closed** issues this month: | 153 |
|Currently open issues in **total**: | 1,361|

Monthly issue metrics for February 2024: https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/12972

All new issues this month were tagged and - where necessary - were followed up to ask for more information.
Additionally, around 55 old issues were revisited in the list, beginning with the oldest in the repository.
An issue metric workflow was added to the repository to automatically create issue related reports on metrics each month, which will be included in the monthly reports.

### Outlook
Next month I will start going in depth though the pile of all old issues, starting with the oldest ones and try figuring out if these are still relevant (try the issues in the weekly builds), if more info is needed, if newer duplicates / better described issues are present or if the issue needs more refinement.
The `Missing: ...` tags will be used to indicate if the issue is still in triage or ready and relevant.
On all the imported issues from the old bug tracker system the main issue will be to identify and ping the relevant people who were involved at the creation of the issue. I will try to replicate bugs and think through the old issues in detail if no other person is commenting.
In case of no replies or unclear issues, the issue will be marked for closing and closed after one month if there is no activity. This is only applicable for the old / imported issues for now.
**It would be nice if people could look out for them and comment, just search the issues for [`is:open is:issue sort:created-asc label:"Missing: feedback"`](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Acreated-asc+label%3A%22Missing%3A+feedback%22)**

Depending of the amount of issues I have to see if I can list them all like the current issues above or if I report a summary (x issues closed because of y).

Additionally, we will manage a project board for the [**FreeCAD Day 2024 Complaint Session**](https://github.com/orgs/FreeCAD/projects/20), search for and add already existing issues which were mentioned (remarks from the discussion will be commented), create new issues for actionable mentions and keep track of the implementation status. The plan is to add all issues or create new one if not existing yet until next months report.

On top I was asked to add the attachments from the old Mantis bugtracker system to the imported issues on GitHub. Currently, there are 359 open issues on GitHub which were imported from the old system and I will try to manually add attachments and images but this will slow down the overall process.
